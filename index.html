    <h1>Graphs</h1>
    <p>
      A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs
      of nodes. The edges may be directed (with an arrow indicating the
      direction) or undirected. Graphs are versatile data structures and can
      model a wide range of relationships, such as social networks,
      transportation networks, or dependencies between tasks.
    </p>

    <p>Graphs can be categorized into two main types:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Directed Graphs (Digraphs):</b> Edges have a direction, indicating a
        one-way relationship from one node to another
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Undirected Graphs:</b> Edges do not have a direction, and the
        relationship between nodes is bidirectional.
      </li>
    </ol>
